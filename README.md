# least-squares-function-fit

## Description
This is an example of a few techniques learned during a course taught at the University of Alberta. This Julia script uses LU-decomposition and Least Squares Function Approximation to find the best fit for a quadratic onto a function, over a domain.

## Disclaimer
This code is not considered reliable, and is frankly quite redundant and not pretty. The purpose of this script is to demonstrate how common numerical methods can be implemented in Julia.
